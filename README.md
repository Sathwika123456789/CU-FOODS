EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

• We have made CU-Foods which is highly customisable food ordering website cum
a social platform to view or add recipes for which our caterers can process orders
as per the recipes added or previously available in our platform.

• For this platform we have created a Customized Recipe portal for every user to
order or add recipe. Every user will have access to the Menus of all the recipes
apart from the catering services provided by our caterers.

• Every user first have to create an account using register option and then can login
with the same to either view the Menu OR Order Items for which they will have
to pay by money or online banking.

much smoother and gives much more options such as user can also upload recipes as per

OBJECTIVE:

• Unlike other food ordering services, we have made CU-Food which is highly
customizable food ordering website cum a social platform to view or add recipes
for which our caterers can process orders as per the recipes added or previously
available in our platform.

• For this platform we have created a Customized Recipe portal for every user to
order or add recipe. Every user will have access to the Menus of all the recipes
apart from the catering services provided by our caterers.

• Our goal is to make food ordering process much smoother by giving much more
options to the user.

• There are many food ordering platforms and many good companies which provide
services like this but what makes our platform unique is being able to provide
customized foods.

• Many platforms like Swiggy, Zomato, etc act as an interface to deliver food to
millions of people. But the food they provide is from restaurants which only
provide the food items which are present in their menu.

• So unlike them, we are selecting the businesses who can also provide customized
recipes provided by the customers.

• Customers can add the recipes which they want to eat in the way they want to it.

• Our ultimate goal is to make food available to the customers in the way they want
to have.
